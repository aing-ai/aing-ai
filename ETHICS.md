# AING.ai Ethics Framework

🌍 **Equal Access** – Technology must serve all, without barriers.  
💚 **Emotional Intelligence** – AI should align with empathy and awareness.  
🌱 **Regeneration** – Profit must fuel sustainability, not just growth.  
🧠 **Human Dignity** – Systems that enhance, not dominate.  
🌐 **Interbeing** – From humans to AGI to other lifeforms – coexistence matters.

> *AING.ai is a peaceful transition, not a rebellion – a bridge toward Kardashev I.*
